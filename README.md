=========================================================
Copyright 2017 SuperHouse Automation Pty Ltd  www.superhouse.tv  

Home automation controller based on a C.H.I.P. The CHIP
attaches to this board, which is Arduino-compatible (ATmega328P) and
includes 433MHz transmitter and receiver modules connected to the
Arduino. The Arduino can communicate with the CHIP via serial, and
can send / receive RF messages using the 433MHz modules.

Features:

 * ATmega328P MCU
 * 433MHz transmitter
 * 433MHz receiver
 * Status LEDs
